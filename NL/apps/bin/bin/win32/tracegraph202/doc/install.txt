To run trgraph.exe you have to install Matlab 6.5 (R13) runtime libraries.
To install the libraries you have to run mglinstaller.exe. Enter destination path, 
for example: c:\mgl. After the installation of the libraries, you have to add the 
bin\win32 subdirectory to the system path variable (PATH), for example: 
SET PATH=c:\mgl\bin\win32. Then you have to unpack files from tracegraph...
(where ... is the program version) directory to the bin\win32 subdirectory. 
After that you can run bin\win32\trgraph.exe. If any error occurs check whether
old Matlab paths in PATH variable are removed.
